<!-- 1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The semantic tags in HTML 5 are used to give meaning and structure to the content of a webpage. I think tags like header, footer, main and section will be very useful, I also see myself using div alot in the future.
2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser moves through the code from top to bottom.
3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to create new snippets, I definately see myself creating my own snippets in the future, it's really handy!
4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I sometimes struggle with when to use what semantic tag, ie section vs div. I can get better at this by reading lots of code (I've been checking out the source code for pages I'm on), also that HTML doctor flow chart is really helpful. -->
