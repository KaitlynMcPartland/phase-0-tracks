1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
sqlite> SELECT * FROM paintings;
|Birth of Venus|1480|1
|Primavera|1482|1
|Pallas and the Centaur|1482|1
|Troubled Queen|1945|2
|Enchanted Forest|1947|2
|The Starry Night|1889|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> UPDATE paintings SET date=1483 WHERE date=1482;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM paintings;
|Birth of Venus|1480|1
|Primavera|1483|1
|Pallas and the Centaur|1483|1
|Troubled Queen|1945|2
|Enchanted Forest|1947|2
|The Starry Night|1889|3

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
