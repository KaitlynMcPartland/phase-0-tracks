1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
sqlite> SELECT * FROM paintings;
1|Birth of Venus|1480|1
2|Primavera|1482|1
3|Pallas and the Centaur|1482|1
4|Troubled Queen|1945|2
5|Enchanted Forest|1947|2
6|The Starry Night|1889|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> UPDATE paintings SET date=1483 WHERE date=1482;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM paintings;
1|Birth of Venus|1480|1
2|Primavera|1483|1
3|Pallas and the Centaur|1483|1
4|Troubled Queen|1945|2
5|Enchanted Forest|1947|2
6|The Starry Night|1889|3

5|Enchanted Forest|1947|2|2|Pollock|false
6|The Starry Night|1889|3|3|Van Gogh|false

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
sqlite> SELECT paintings.name, paintings.date, artists.name FROM paintings JOIN artists ON paintings.artist_id = artists.id;
Birth of Venus|1480|Boticelli
Primavera|1483|Boticelli
Pallas and the Centaur|1483|Boticelli
Troubled Queen|1945|Pollock
Enchanted Forest|1947|Pollock
The Starry Night|1889|Van Gogh


5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> DELETE FROM paintings WHERE date=1480;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM paintings;
2|Primavera|1483|1
3|Pallas and the Centaur|1483|1
4|Troubled Queen|1945|2
