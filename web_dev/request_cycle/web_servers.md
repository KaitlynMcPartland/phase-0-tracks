#What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Modularity is at the core of the Linux design philosophy. Linux programs as generally designed with the intention of doing one thing, doing it well, and making it so it easily interacts with other programs.

This focus on modularity is part of what allows Linux's unique development cycle to exist. Linux is essentially open sourced and it built and maintained by people who volunteer to write new programs and add new features. The modular nature of Linux allows people to write programs independantly.

#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A virtual private server is a portion of a server that is your individual virtual machine provided to you by the hosting service you are using. You can run your own operating system on it and configure it how you like. Configuration and creation is easier on a VPS than on a physical server because it is software defined. Your information is more protected than with shared hosting because you aren't sharing a server with other customers. VPS are less expensive than dedicated private servers.


#Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
For security purposes it's better not to use the root user. Root user has administrative security and can access everything, so a problem or virus on one program will also have access to everything.
