#jQuery study plan
- Try and find a mozilla doc on it
- Search for jQuery cheat sheets
- Check if there are any code academy courses
- Try to test any major topic out once you have a basic understanding of it
- Tke 2 breaks over the two hours - breaks are proven to increase your learning potential

- The thing that taught me the most was a code along thing that helped me actually experiment and try things out. I think that testing things and seeing what worked and what it actually did helped me wrap my head around some concepts.
